# Innovative Air Pollution Monitoring and Reduction in J7 Aircraft Using Advanced Sensor Technologies

This project introduces a smart IoT-based air pollution monitoring system for J7 aircraft. Using advanced sensors and an Arduino Mega 2560, the system detects pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, CO, CH4, NH3, and monitors temperature, humidity, pressure, and dust. Data is transmitted in real-time using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to cloud platforms like ThingSpeak or AWS IoT for analysis and visualization.

The system not only monitors air quality but also supports pollution reduction strategies through engine optimization, improved filtration, and data-driven maintenance.

##Technologies & Components Used
- Arduino Mega 2560
- ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module
- Sensors: Honeywell HPM, SDS011, TGS 826, 3SP_CO_1000, MiCS-5524, BME280, GP2Y1010AU0F
- HTML/CSS for dashboard (optional)
- ThingSpeak / AWS IoT for cloud integration

## Features
- Real-time pollutant detection (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NH3, CH4)
- Environmental monitoring (humidity, temperature, pressure)
- Wireless data transmission via ESP8266
- Cloud integration for data storage and visualization
- Predictive analysis using AWS IoT & SageMaker (optional extension)
- Aircraft-friendly enclosure design

## Purpose
To enhance in-cabin air quality in J7 aircraft, ensure crew/passenger safety, and support sustainability in aviation through smart monitoring and reduction of pollutants.

## Setup Overview
- Connect sensors to Arduino Mega
- Power using 5V supply (3.3V for specific sensors like BME280)
- Transmit data using ESP8266 to cloud server
- Visualize and analyze data on ThingSpeak/AWS
- Optional: Use AWS IoT with QuickSight for dashboards and SageMaker for predictions

## Results
- Successful integration of multiple sensors
- Real-time monitoring enabled
- Foundation for predictive maintenance and green aviation practices
